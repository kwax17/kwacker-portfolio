## The website funtions as a portfolio

The header has my name and navigation bar, which when clicked on scrolls to its section.  Next is the header, which is a personal photo with an alt tag, and the subtitle.  The section titles each have a border on the right that epands for their section content.  I have a short bio in the about me section. That is followed by the work section. Since I only have one really completed project, the only active link is the first.  For this reason, that box is bigger than the others.  This section is followed by my contact info, which links to both my Linkedin and Github.
